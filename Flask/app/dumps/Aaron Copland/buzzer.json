This man formed a friendship with the Mexican composer Carlos Ch\u00e1vez to whom his second symphony, the Short Symphony, is dedicated. This man also wrote the music for the opera The Tender Land and later composed the orchestral work Connotations. This composer's third and final symphony was premiered by Serge Koussevitzky, and its final movement forms the basis for his Fanfare for the Common Man.
